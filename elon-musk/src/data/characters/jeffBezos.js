      <h2>About Spend Jeff Bezos' Money</h2>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>Spend Jeff Bezos' Money</strong>, the simulator that puts you in control of one of the largest retail and tech fortunes in human history.</p>
      
      <p>We've loaded your virtual account with <strong>$244 Billion</strong>—the current estimated net worth of the man who started it all in a garage and ended up building a global empire. In this game, your "Prime" membership is upgraded to the ultimate level: Unlimited.</p>
      
      <h3>What Can You Do With $244 Billion?</h3>
      <p>Ever wondered what it's like to buy the most expensive super-yacht in the world and still have 99.9% of your money left? Or perhaps you want to fund a mission to the Moon just for fun?</p>
      
      <p>From the iconic Koru super-yacht to the Washington Post, or even just billions of boxes of basic supplies, you have the power to spend like a man who views the entire Earth (and low-Earth orbit) as his marketplace.</p>
      
      <h3>The "Bezos Speed" of Wealth</h3>
      <p>Jeff Bezos' wealth isn't just large; it grows at a speed that is hard for the human brain to process. Let's look at the numbers for 2026:</p>
      
      <h4>Spending Rate</h4>
      <p>How long to spend $244 Billion?</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>$1,000 per Second</strong> ~7.7 Years (You'd have to spend 24/7!)</li>
        <li><strong>$1 Million per Day</strong> ~668 Years (Since the mid-1300s)</li>
        <li><strong>$100,000 per Hour</strong> ~278 Years (Longer than the USA has existed)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><em>Mind-Blowing Fact: In 2026, Jeff Bezos earns approximately $911 per second. By the time you finish reading this sentence, he has already earned enough to buy a high-end MacBook Pro.</em></p>
      
      <h3>The Reality Check</h3>
      <p>How does your bank account stack up against the Amazon founder? Let's compare:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Eternal Shift:</strong> If you earn $65,000 a year, you would need to work for 3.75 million years (and spend nothing) to save up as much as Jeff has right now.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Pocket Change" Scale:</strong> For someone with Jeff's wealth, spending $1 million feels the same as an average person spending about $4. Buying a $500 million super-yacht is like you buying a nice dinner out.</li>
        <li><strong>The Space Race:</strong> Jeff spends about $1 billion a year just to fund his space company, Blue Origin. Most people couldn't spend $1 billion in a lifetime; for him, it's just an annual subscription fee.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The "Add to Cart" button has never been this powerful.</p>
      
      <p>Start your spending spree now and see if you can actually empty the vault of the man who owns the world's biggest store!</p>
